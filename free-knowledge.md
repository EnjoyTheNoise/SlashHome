# Free Knowledge
## Quick Intro
Here goes my quick essay on free knowledge. Some of this might sound like BS, but that's my opinion. If you have 
something to critisize, sure, I don't mind criticism as long as it's constructive and explains why something won't
work as I described it, instead of just saying 'No'. I believe that knowledge should be free! What does that mean?  

## Theory
I think education should be completely free, as well as any knowledge you can obtain. This sounds very sketchy -
since that would mean that anyone in the world could learn how to create a hydrogen bomb or hack his neighbours
network. So, naturally - this wouldn't work in our world, since some people always strive for more posessions,
popularity and power and thus would misuse the knowledge to reach their goal. In order to achieve something like
this, one would need different goals and motivations. Goals like providing help to everyone in need of help, for
example due to natural catastrophes, or - as now - global pandemics. Doing this not as a paid service, but as a 
volunteer action! I also believe that knowledge itself - cannot hurt people. Knowledge is a very powerful weapon,
which in some cases can annihilate whole landscapes and in other cases return a person who was one foot away from
the gates of death. It comes down to what we do with this power!

## Practice
I am neither a medic nor a geo-physicist, so I can't help with many problems I would like to help with. I can't
state anything about COVID (SARS-CoV-2), except for what I'm being told by the virologists who are experts in these fields 
and I don't mind getting information like that. I - without a doubt - can say that the world has a lot more to
offer than what you can learn in several life times, so splitting work and knowledge is basically an necessary
requirement! The problem of it at the moment is that in many countries education is paid, which hinders progress!
I do understand that our world - as is, functions in a way that you need money to survive and that you own money
by working and for some people teaching is a job and their only way of getting money, **but** doing nothing in that
case implies that we value the lives of teachers more than those of who can't afford basic education, which is a wrong
approach in my opinion. You can't compare lives and potential futures in any case! We do not know what the person
will make with their life, so we have to try and give as many people as possible a basic education and some common
knowledge to give them a chance to succeed in life!

## My Input
What I do is both fairly simple and limited. I am learning Computer Science - since that's a subject / a science I
feel comfortable with. I believe it has a future and a lot of interesting applications - the special thing about
computer science is, that you can combine it with most (natural) sciences and get a great result! Such as 
Bioinformatics (which as the name says originated from Biology and Informatics (Information Technology) and offers
awesome solutions, such as advanced prosthetic limbs! Same with other fields starting from simple visualization of
collected data using digital devices ranging to complex data processing and predictions using Aritifical Intelligence
and Machine Learning!  
That's the reason I started learning CS and every day I am - both, learning and teaching something new to someone.
I try to keep up a good amount of common knowledge, so I can help people who struggle with common problems! 

## Conclusion
Now let's get to the actual point of this essay - I do this for free, why? Because I believe that in Free and Easy Access to
knowledge there is a key to the future - if everyone would be educated about basic politics, ethics and philisophy
with a mix of culture and naturally developed tolerance - we could have a society without war and major conflicts!  
If everyone would be educated about biology and technology we would probably able to solve problems on a global
scope much faster and easier. What I do is a small stepping stone for a huge goal, I obviously won't be able to complete
myself. But if you never start you won't get anywhere!
