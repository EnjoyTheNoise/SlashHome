# Thank You

Heya, another year has passed and the list of people to thank for my wonderful time continues to grow consistently - I lost touch with some and picked others back up again - life changes and so do the people around you, so here's my thank you to everyone who contributed to my well-being, learning, fun times, etc. This list is **not** ordered - I have shuffled it. You can jump to your entry, by typing something like: `https://github.com/QueenOfDoom/SlashHome/blob/master/thank-you-2020.md#username`. The username, has to be written in lower-case letters and spaces are replaced with `-`. There's a lot more I'd like to tell y'all, but I only got limited time, so I hope that these short texts will do :big_toocan_heart:! This was a tough year for all of us - the pandemic really went wild at times and some of us had it even worse with Typhoons & Strorms, but I believe and am very sure, that the next year will be better than the last and I'll do my best to make your next year a little brighter, by attempting to return in kind what you have given me this year <3!

## Kami Shinjo

> *the Genshin addict with the voice of Morgan Freeman*

Kami, ('/kami/' not '/kæmi/'), another year has passed - out interactions have decreased by quite a bit, but that's ok - we all got our lifes to live and sometimes work, ~~Genshin~~ and jobs overwhelm us, so I'd like to thank you for the not so many, but nonetheless fun times I had this year talking to you and thank you for your continued support along my journey :D. I'll try to increase the time I'm on the server next year - but as always, life gives and takes opportunities, a lot of things have changed compared to the past. I've grown a lot in this last year (not physically - still the same height :XD:) and I wish you a healthy, fantastic and lovely time in this upcoming year! Stay the awesome person you are and continue growing as a person <3!

## Shane

> *the artistic (respectable) walnut*

As with Kami, we didn't have too many chances to talk this year - and as with Kami, that's mostly on me :laughing: - I'll really try to be more active on the server! I need to catch up after all how shane became a walnut after all :kek:. I'll be reading back for years. Such a sha~~m~~ne I wasn't there when it happened. A lot of things happened in this past year, including an identity change and a lot of awesome artworks, that I've been watching from afar :smile:. I'm proud of you - you're definitely going to become a great professional artist one day - until then, keep honing your skills! Naturally, I wish you a most wonderful year and a really fantastic time!

## Kazu Kun

> 2020 was the tutorial stage

> 2021 was the first level, huh?

ありがとうございます for all your contributions to my never ending road, full of adventures, called "life". You're an awesome person and to my knowledge an experienced gamer and talkshow host. You have, just like many people from this list - an awesome music taste! (I still have [Houkai Sekai no Utahime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZLfaZMpe0), which you have shown me more than a year ago, in my playlists and it won't disappear from there!)

May your luck in life ~~and for pulls~~ never run out! Stay healthy and do your best!

Heyo, Tempest - 5 messages in 2020 xD. Maybe we can reach a bit higher in the next year :smile_cat:.

Best wishes for the upcoming year! Do you best!

## Alimo

> Doomer's not gonna sleep if we do ditf now (still the best quote, so I'll leave it here :XD:)

Good day, Alimo ^^! Eyo - another year has passed and - we barely had any interactions, but the ones we had were awesome! Thanks, Alimo for another wonderful year and I hope that once I am more active on the server, I'll get the chance to talk to you more often!

Thou shalt have a fantastic year mate... and of course stay healthy! May the Riven Roll Luck be on your side xD. Heard Australia was going nuts at times during this pandemic - so, stay safe! Continue being a nice and awesome person! Really appreciate ya!

## Guren

> Education corner is general right?

Oi, another awesome person that barely ever talks, but if they talk it's wonderful :kek: - I am very glad to have metcha! You rose from 292 to 413 messages in the last year, that's some progress :kek:! I hope you're enjoying life and everything that comes with it! You're an awesome person and we sure had some time to talk about interesting things (:wink:) this year. On another note - I definitely took over the habit of filling my chat history with emotes from ya :laughing:! Again: thanks for being there, without you my year would definitely be a bit more bland and plain!

## Promiselight

> *the exuberant mathematician*

This delightful paragraph is for you, Promise ^^! You know that I can't stop with the puns :sataXD:! Now comes the time for the professional cook, singer and mathematician - Promiselight :kek:. Hope that once I'll be more active on the server, I'll have the opportunity to have more chats with you! Sometimes I'm reminiscing about the late night math assignment courses - it was a **hilarious** time thinking back :D. Now you've grown a lot! Not sure if you did it last year already and were just showing less than this year, but I'm glad that your cooking skill constantly improves as can be seen in the #self channel :D. Really proud of ya <3

## Agye

> Well, i play guitar and piano, and ukulele and sing

Heya Agye, I know you for quite a while and I'm happy I got to know you a bit better over the course of the year. You're a very talented musician and artist, combined with the interest in anime that makes you a very interesting person! As last year - I truly wish you the best of luck on your studies of Korean & Music and hope you'll make a good decision in the next few years when you'll have to choose between further studies or pursuing a career immediately! Take your time and approach this next year with care as it comes with responsible decisions! Though don't forget the fun things in life :kek:, wish you all the best!

## Tari

>
> ~~there are so many more xD I don't want the quote section to be too long, but you get the idea~~

Yo, tari - so... Lots of things to say, hehehe. It's been a long and rough year - especially for you! Getting from one catastrophe into another, truly gloomy. I couldn't find any good statistics for this year, but I know as a matter of fact that natural catastrophies are a rather common thing where you live. Add to that the inability to play Genshin and it seems like you really are outta luck! Jokes aside - I'm truly greatful for this year with you - you taught me lots of things and helped me understand some things better! You're frankly - a fantastic, smart mentor, kind friend, (~~addicted gamer and passionate alcoholic~~). The amount of funny moments I had thanks to you is immense :kek:

> No it just so happens to be chocolate fudge now but my favorite is NSA vanilla!!
>
> National Security Agency Vanilla?
>
> No sugar added :laughing: :laughing: :laughing: 

Same goes for teaching Douma, who has trouble dealing with frustration - a lot of thanks, means a lot to me if someone can be honest with me and sometimes tell me the asshole I am :laughing: (no sarcasm here or anything, I mean it)!

I wish you a wonderful, safe and lovely year with lots of surprises coming towards ya! Safety and Health is the most important - especially where you're at! After that come Happiness and Satisfaction! I hope this will be the year where you find your cruise :kek: - ya know, a ship's not a cage :kek: - it's a way to stay afloat these days!

## Ampharos

> Status: *dancing to 'All Star' while watching Shrek, do not disturb*

Another year has passed and the king of the bathtub has found a queen :kek:! Another year has passed and I still just know your music tastes and your love for Pokémon and certain anatidae :kek:. Hope you're doing fantastic. Keep up your great mood, chef :wink:! And take care of your bird :kek:! Hope I'll be able to talk to you or chill out with ya more next year! Meanwhile - have a fantastic time and enjoy life as much as possible, while staying safe and healthy! 

You got wings, take good care of them, after all it's them that make you fly :wink: and the wings will get you to the highest heights :heart:.

I'll leave you one more '[gift](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6X1vrsdOwwv32HNUjXycqM?si=49de4caf34de45cd)' that I created this year, thanks to you!

## Duckieeee

> *quack*

Let's welcome the queen of the bathtub that you've become this year :kek:. You - just like Amph were the cause of my fantastic mood a countless amount of times - in fact, even more than you think, because one of my main origins of happiness is good music, with the playlist you sent me a while ago, I've been going through the highest heights and the deepest depths, so I appreciate you a TON. You really *amped* up my dose of daily happiness :kek:. Hope we'll have time to meet up on the server, if I'll manage to become more active :D.

Alrighty - the wishes: Stay kind & great as you are and take care of the king - make sure to treasure him and bring him to his high's for he is truly a worthy king - both - of the bathtub and IRL. Stay safe and healthy in this new year and make the best outta it!

## Bear

> You don't need to **bear** with it though :NicoSmug:

The story writer and aspiring software engineer! Shalt you struggle - shoot me a DM _any time_, never ever worry about bothering me! I'm never bothered by friends who seek help or advice. The end of the the year was awesome, thanks for entrusting me to help ya! Being able to help a friend out is truly a great gift - made me feel happy :D. Please also, stay safe and healthy at all times. I wish you a truly wonderful start into the new year :heart: and that you'll achieve all goals you plan on achieving!

You're a super smart and insanely talented, kind person! Love all of whatchu make! Every of your products is made with such immense craftmanship - it's insane. I'm really really proud of you! 

You'll be even greater than you already do in the future. It doesn't require a magician to tell that your future is bright and promising - so I hope that the next year will be a great one for ya! You'll learn and practice a lot of new stuff and take what you already know to the next level! I'm genuinely looking forward to what you will bring us in 2022!

Stay safe, healthy and keep honing your skills!

Heyyyy, even though you're one of the OG's - I don't think I talked too often to you, especially this year - so instead of saying something that might be outdated or untrue, I'll just leave some wishes - stay healthy and happy! Try to enjoy school as much as you can and make great decisions as your future catches up to you :wink:

## Paladin

> YALL HOMIES STAYING HYDRATED? HERE!

*as I'm writing this:* lemme take a sip of water before I approach this one.  
Alright, so, happy new Year, Paladin, we made it _another_ year - this one has been pretty hard on ya - or so I recall, I won't go into details, instead let's be happy now that a new year with new opportunities and chances approaches! I hope you're doing fantastic and I still haven't found the one way speed of light :laugh:. As always I am always happy for random physics/math facts - still remember the wonderful logistical curve video you sent. You of all people know how important it is to stay hydrated \*takes a sip\*. You're doing a fantastic job and we all love ya! Stay safe and healthy in these dark days :)!

## Rei

> I'm not actually a person, but a brain in a jar with the sole purposes of reading yuri, shitposting, and dj-ing on random servers  

Well, let's get to Grumpah's (and not only) favorite brain in a jar!  

This is actually my favorite quote of yours heheheh, everytime you say something, it's brilliant smart and philosophical. I'm really glad to have such an omniscient friend :kek:.

You have a great personality and you don't avoid struggles, but face them head-on, which I personally find a very cool quality! I hope that you will have an immaculate new year, with great opportunities and perfect moments while vibing to da chunes!

I love you and you know that, sorry for the mocking :sadcat:. Snowiee - the greatest Yuri Conaisseur of all time, shall have an awesome transition from 2021 to 2022. You gave me a lot of very memorable moments, all those novels, webtoons & manga you recommend - they really never miss! Snow got a taste that's best described with the word "perfect" - every time I get a message from ya it makes me really happy! I genuinely enjoyed the time I spent with you, it was suuper fun and I hope we will spend not less, but much more time texting and watching Anime this upcoming year! This year is also very meaningful to you in that you found someone that you shall treasure and keep safe. A relationship comes with its own challenges - for which I am more than sure you are ready and will overcome them! I'm really happy you found someone you can rely on! Thanks for being a great friend, I hope your 2022, will be just as awesome as everyone else's! Can't stress this enough, so here I go again: You're friggin immaculate!

## Spennorex

> [...] will be adding central user management, SSO, Email server

Heya, here we are, one year down, another one to come ^^! I see that my wish from last year has come true :kek:! You're a very techy guy and I've seen your knowledge grow over the past 1.5-2 years! I'm really proud of the progress you made in that while and of the network you're setting up at the moment! Perfection and attention to detail are hard-to-find qualities nowadays and yet I see them very clearly in your character!

I wish you best of luck in your personal life as well as in the things you're passionate about!

## Kami Bayushi

> Shinjo-chan uses me as an armrest [...] I'm still growing [...] (ㆆ _ ㆆ)

Hope you grew a bit over the last year, Miss Bayushi. I sometimes scroll up in the self / art channel to remind myself of how beautiful art can be :heart:. It's amazing to see young talent, so I'd love to see you make it to the top and become a great professional artist!

## Canter

> *will be sponsored by Godot eventually*

Another year has passed and you keep growing - the server as well as yourself! I'm really proud of both you and the server you maintain! It's incredible how much you have achieved despite being relatively young! Every once in a while I get to witness that greatness in form of DM's or you helping others or myself. I learned a ton of stuff from you, so I am genuinely really really thankful for that! You're the best // TODO

## DukeTwo-Can

> - That is really neat ngl, but I still prefer guis lol
> - I definitely value your input and respect your experience and knowledge on a lot of topics :D

Yoooo, Duke - time for my yearly tradition :kek: - now you get what I mean :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. Alrighty - first the thanks:

Thank you a lot for being a reliable, kind, nice, incredibly generous and overall legendary friend. If I would search the world, I guarantee you that I would have a hard time finding many people nicer than you! At the same time you're pretty honest, straight-forward and rational, which makes it easy and pleasant to talk to you! You got a great voice and I'm proud of your fitness progress that I get to witness from time to time either through words or pictures you send! Your knowledge in manga and light novels is also great as well as your professional skills concerning AI - you're really an impressive human being that I am proud to have met! The amount of times you send memes or songs and brighten my day is impressive, let alone the money you wasted on me with the numerous Nitro's. Really can't appreciate ya enough! Your presence means so much to me and the casual and professional talks we have are nice! I'm always glad to help and be useful to you, so ask me any questions, any time! I'd be more than happy to answer whatever is within my area of knowledge.

For the new year I wish you a lot of happy moments and that sad things you had to live through this year, will be a much less frequent occurrence the next year! I also hope the same for the ones you care about, such as the sister and niece you told me a few times about :kek: - keep them safe and healthy! Be a great brother and uncle <3, as you are a great friend!

## Krista

> *Douma explains another concept*  
> Krista:  
> - Oh, ffs - when this gonna end?!

> - Why do you keep torturing me?

Oiii, Krista, thank you for this wonderful year. A lot has happened and a lot more is about to happen as the new year is going to start! I hope that your academic life will go smoothly and that you'll find lots of new stuff to experience and learn! A long journey is set before ya and you'll have to make your choices and soon enough you'll have a fulltime professional career - I'm sure that you'll get to work where you wanna work and achieve what you wanna achieve! After all it's you - the legendary GOAT herself :wink:. The hours spent within Games & Spotify w/ ya are truly priceless and I'm really really glad that we managed to find some time to spend together as that's usually an insanely hard thing to do across time zones. Thank you for your continued emotional support in tough times and for the great amount of patience you have for me! I can be annoying at times (trust me, I know myself :XD: - so thanks a lot for putting up w/ me at all times). Interactions with ya of any sort always end up with me being in a better mood than I was before, so you're much much appreciated!

I wish you great & unwavering health along with success and fortune (in both the luck and money sense) in all the future years to come! Be the best version of yourself in the 2022 and top it off each year that is to come!

## Will

## MrDudeBro

> Thank God not everyone's an idiot in the world

Heyo, MrDudeBro - hopefully you're doing well on this fine transition to the new year - after all it happens just once in a year :laughing:, so it'd be a waste to be a in a bad mood! You're a person with remarkable kindness, which many (including myself) do not possess! It's really nice to have you as a friend and moral compass in the mod team! Keep up your learning progress and I hope you'll be able to start your professional IT career soon!

## Forbidden

Yo, Forb! Hope you had an excellent transition into the next year! Now there's three 2's in the year :smile:!

Anyways, keep your Rust & JS Journey up! Keep learning - after all 'We all get the exact same 365 days. The only difference is what we do with them.'

Stay healthy and neva give up, ya got everything you aim for in reach!

## The Highlander

> How funny it is that I accidentally turned my wife into a communist without even noticing.

Heyo, Highlander! So - first off, happy birthday __and__ happy new year! What an incredible occasion to tell you my words of gratitude for all the chats we had! Especially the long and interesting arguments about politics and society! Loved those moments! You're a fantastic person, with a great mindset!

Thou shalt stay healthy & safe from the pandemic and other sicknesses! I hope your mood will be at top levels always and that you'll have a very pleasant 2022!

## Everyone

You may or may not be on this list. If you're not on this list it doesn't mean that I got nothing to thank you for! I may have forgotten to include you or perhaps I just didn't make it in time - if I would include every person I'm thankful for being in my life, I'd need to start the 2022 edition starting tomorrow :laughing:. So in short: for everyone who's not on this list (and for those on the list) and reading this: please stay healthy and well-fed & hydrated at all times, but especially during this pandemic where we need to take of ourselves very well!

I wish you all best of luck and happiness in this new year!
